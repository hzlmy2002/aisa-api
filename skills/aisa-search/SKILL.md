# AIsa Web Search & Research

Web search, page extraction, crawling and grounded research through Tavily, Firecrawl, Exa, Perplexity, Oxylabs, txyz, and Anthropic/OpenAI grounded search.

Optional input: `task` (default `""`) — what you want to find out.

27 operations across these servers: `web-search`. Read [operation coverage](references/operations.md) to select an operation, then read its schema.

Use the local MCP server named `aisa-api`. Read the linked local operation details for its full description, input schema, defaults and annotations; then execute with `use({operation_id: "<id>", arguments: {...}})`. You do not need to call get_details when the installed details already provide the contract. Use `get_details({operation_id: "<id>"})` if local details are missing or the installed skills and running server differ; the running server's schema takes precedence. Prices and live availability are enforced by the AIsa gateway, not these static files.

Include `max_price_usd` when needed: it applies to each upstream request, including composed fan-outs, not the workflow total. Use `batch_use` for up to 20 independent calls; keep dependent steps sequential. If the exact operation is pinned, it can also be called directly with its schema.

A matching workflow already links its required operations: read those details directly without loading the global directory. For other tasks, start with the short installed `aisa-api` skill and follow a relevant server index. Use `search` only when the right operation is unclear. Native MCP resources/read can read `skill://aisa-api/SKILL.md` or `skill://aisa-api/references/operations/<operation_id>.md`. Skills do not execute actions or expand the user's authorization.

Plan the minimal call set; use a tool's list input instead of looping when available. Label unavailable sources and any substitutes.

Relevant installed workflow skills:

- `aisa-brand-mentions-across-social` — Use when asked to collect brand or product mentions across X, Reddit and Instagram. 跨多个社交平台收集品牌或产品提及，对比各平台反馈。
- `aisa-creator-profile-snapshot` — Use when asked for an audience and recent-content snapshot of a creator or public account. 分析创作者或公开账号的个人资料、受众和最近发布的内容。
- `aisa-research-brief` — Use when asked to research one question on the open web and produce a short sourced brief. 围绕一个问题进行公开网页研究，交叉核实资料，撰写带引用的简报。
