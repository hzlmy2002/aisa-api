  "description": "Long-tail variants containing one `keyword` - the phrase-match view, where `post_dataforseo_labs_google_keyword_ideas_live` is the semantic one. Returns `seed_keyword`, `seed_keyword_data`, `total_count`, `offset_token` and `items`. Pages with `limit`, `offset` and `offset_token`; use the token past the first pages. Measured at 3.2 KB with a limit of 1. 💰 Measured at $0.01212 upstream, essentially the flat rate billed. **This family is the one to reach for by default**: the google_ads endpoints in seo-keywords answer similar questions at $0.09 - seven times more - and return megabytes with no way to cap them, where this one takes a `limit`. Wrapped in DataForSEO's envelope: data in `tasks[0].result`, outcome in `tasks[0].status_code` - a rejected request still returns HTTP 200.",
