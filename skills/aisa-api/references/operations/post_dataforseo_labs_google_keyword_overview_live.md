## Contract

  "operation_id": "post_dataforseo_labs_google_keyword_overview_live",
  "successful": true,
  "description": "Everything Labs knows about a list of `keywords` in one call: volume, difficulty, intent, competition and the SERP features they trigger. Returns `se_type`, `location_code`, `language_code`, `items_count` and `items`. Measured at 5.9 KB for one keyword. 💰 Measured at $0.01212 upstream, essentially the flat rate billed - the google_ads endpoints in seo-keywords answer similar questions at $0.09. This one takes no limit parameter, but it is priced per call rather than per item, so send the whole list at once. Wrapped in DataForSEO's envelope: data in `tasks[0].result`, outcome in `tasks[0].status_code` - a rejected request still returns HTTP 200. Start here when you have keywords; `post_dataforseo_labs_google_keyword_ideas_live` is where to go when you need more of them.",
