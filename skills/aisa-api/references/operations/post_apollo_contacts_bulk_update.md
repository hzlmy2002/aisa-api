# post_apollo_contacts_bulk_update

Installed API contract. Read arguments_schema, construct the arguments object, then call use with this operation_id. get_details is optional if this installed contract matches the running server. Credentials come from local setup; do not pass Authorization. Prices and availability here are unknown; the gateway enforces them. response_schema documents the original MCP output and is not enforced on provider responses.
