  "description": "Where a set of Amazon products rank overall - the product-level equivalent of a domain rank overview. 💰 Measured at $0.01212 upstream, essentially the flat rate billed - the google_ads endpoints in seo-keywords answer similar questions at $0.09. This one takes no limit parameter, but it is priced per call rather than per item, so send the whole list at once. Wrapped in DataForSEO's envelope: data in `tasks[0].result`, outcome in `tasks[0].status_code` - a rejected request still returns HTTP 200. For the keywords behind those rankings use `post_dataforseo_labs_amazon_ranked_keywords_live`.",
